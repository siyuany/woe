This is an R package that calculates Weight Of Evidence. 

It was originally written by Sudarson Mothilal Thoppay <sudarson@outlook.com>. I just forked the project from CRAN and fixed some bugs.

## Installation

Make sure you have install `devtools` package in your R software. If you haven't, please first install it.

```
install.packages('devtools')
```

Load `devtools` and use `install_github` to install the package with the following statements:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('siyuany/woe')
```
